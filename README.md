# Panda3DS-GUI-Wrapper
GUI Wrapper for people who are scared of command lines

## DISCLAIMER: this wrapper is very useless, it doesn't add any extra features and I made it for fun.

# Usage
## 1. installation
The `installer.exe` binary is just an installer for the app. it installs the executable and all of its files in AppData. 
the `portable.zip` binary is just all the libraries and files along with the exe. it's for ppl who don't really wanna use installers (I am one of them)

## 2. How to use
To load a rom, you can drag & drop a file into the main home window, or click `File -> Load ROM`.
To change settings, you can click `Settings -> Modify` and change whatever you want. Just make sure you click `OK` to save your changes.
To view this repo and the original Panda3ds repo, click `About` and choose which repo you would like to visit.
To view the unonofficial compatibility sheet, click `Compatibility Sheet -> View`.
To use older versions of panda, find where you installed the wrapper and replace `alber.exe` in the `res` folder.
